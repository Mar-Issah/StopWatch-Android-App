<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage
[Click here](https://res.cloudinary.com/dytnpjxrd/video/upload/v1618446694/My%20Website%20Projects/stopwatchVid_nvnkkf.mp4) to view demo.

Stopwatch is an android app which counts up time. When the user press the start button, the time begins to count increasing by 1 every second. When the user press the stop button, the timer stops. When the user press the reset button it clears the timer and set it back to default. The app still runs even if the user rotates the screen.
